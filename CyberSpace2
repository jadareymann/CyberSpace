            Welcome to **CyberDefender: The Internet Safety Mission!**

            As you’re browsing online, your screen flickers and suddenly fades to black. A message appears, glowing with a challenge:

            _"Welcome to the Cyber Defender Mission. Only those with sharp instincts and internet safety skills can join this elite team. Your mission: navigate through different online zones, make wise decisions, and protect yourself from cyber threats. Each correct choice will fill your Security Level Meter, moving you closer to earning the title of Cyber Defender."_

            You hover over the button that reads **ACCEPT MISSION**, and with a click, your screen transforms.

            A digital map appears, revealing different “zones” to navigate—like the Login Hub, Social Network Grove, Message Bridge, and Download Zone. At the top of the map is a Security Level Meter, currently at zero. With each smart decision you make, the meter will fill, unlocking new levels of security and bringing you closer to the rank of Cyber Defender.

            Your task is clear: complete the zones, protect your profile, and climb the Security Level Meter to prove you’re ready to join the Cyber Defenders.
